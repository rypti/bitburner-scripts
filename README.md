# bitburner-scripts


You can import these scripts by running the following in Bitburner.

# Get the importer
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rypti/bitburner-scripts/main/import.js import.js`
# Configure your Import
You can configure your import inside `import.js`.
```
    config = {
        folder: 'scripts',
        rootUrl: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChaelCodes/bitburner-scripts/main/',
        serverPrefix: 'ChaelPwns',
    };
```

- `folder` will determine where your scripts are stored
- `rootUrl` is the source, if you fork this repo, update this to you repo
- `serverPrefix` your automatically purchased servers will be filtered from auto hacks using this prefix. Pick a fun name!
